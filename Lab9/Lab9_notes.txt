# Lab 9 – Port Scanning & Network Detection (Nmap)

**Environments**
- Windows 10 VM (Scanner)
- Ubuntu 24.04 VM (Target)
- VMware Host-Only Network

---

## Tasks Completed
- Installed Nmap on Windows VM
- Performed default Nmap scan against Ubuntu target
- Conducted TCP SYN (stealth) scan
- Captured scan traffic in Wireshark
- Identified open, closed, and filtered ports
- Enabled UFW firewall rules to modify scan results
- Re-scanned target to observe firewall impact
- Saved packet captures for documentation

---

## Observations (Default Scan)
- Open ports detected: 22 (SSH), 53 (DNS)
- Closed ports returned TCP RST responses
- UDP scans returned ICMP Port Unreachable messages
- Wireshark confirmed active probing of multiple ports

---

## Observations (SYN / Stealth Scan)
- Scanner sent TCP SYN packets to target ports
- Open ports responded with SYN-ACK
- Windows host sent RST to avoid completing handshake
- Closed ports responded with RST
- Scan demonstrated half-open TCP behavior used in reconnaissance

---

## Observations (Firewall Enabled)
- After blocking port 22 using UFW, SYN packets received no response
- Wireshark showed TCP retransmissions
- Nmap identified port 22 as "filtered"
- Behavior confirmed firewall silently dropping packets

---

## Port State Analysis
- **Open**: Service actively listening (SYN-ACK response)
- **Closed**: Host reachable but no service (RST response)
- **Filtered**: No response due to firewall drop
- **ICMP Port Unreachable**: UDP port closed

---

## Security & Detection Insights
- Port scanning generates detectable network patterns
- SYN scans avoid completing full TCP handshake
- Firewall rules directly influence port scan visibility
- Wireshark can be used to identify reconnaissance behavior
- Retransmissions indicate silent filtering
- RST responses indicate explicit rejection

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- Wireshark
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- Windows Command Prompt
- Ubuntu 24.04 VM
- Windows 10 VM
